# Eldr (Evaluated, light, direct, recursive) lang
âš  *This project is still in development and may lack some controls or functionalities.*

Eldrlang is an evaluated language with no professional purpose and inspired in [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.
Made for fun during summer it attempts to execute scripts and raw code from console following a specific syntax.

## Syntax
### Declaring a variable
- var string = "hello";
- var number = 1;
### Executing a loop
- loop { doX(); }
### Declaring a function
- fun f(param) { return param; }
- f(1);

## How to execute
Just compile the root directory Eldrlang and run.
